Read the [svelte-kit's docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs) if you are interested.

## Developing

First, check `.env.sample` and build your own `.env` based on that.

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `yarn`, start a development server:

```bash
yarn dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn dev --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
yarn build
```

You can preview the production build with `yarn preview`.
